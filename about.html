      <h1>About This Website</h1>
      <p>
        It's not a long story. Started a couple weeks ago when I was thinking
        about what I should do with my life. I had no idea. I had the though to
        look up the MATC website to see if they had anything cool. Their Web
        Development program caught my attention. I looked into enrolling in the
        program, but found that I either needed to take an intro to programming
        class where I could learn the basics of Web Development, or, take a Web
        Development competency test. Being the extremely confident, well
        skilled, can learn anything kind of person that I am, was not about to
        waste time and money on a class when I could teach myself the same
        things for free in just a couple weeks.
        <br />I had taken an web design class in high school so I had a general
        idea of the basics of Web Development. I watched a handful of youtube
        videos and decided that it was time for a project. I sent a message in a
        group text with by Brother and Cousin asking for ideas. They sent back
        mostly weird ideas, but a handful of gems came through. My brother
        suggested I build a website that would tell the user all of the holdiays
        on the current date. Sounded easy enough. So I got to work. About 4
        hours later, I had completed the website you're reading now. I'm sure
        there will be tweaks and adjustments in the future, but we'll see.
        Thanks for reading. I really didn't want to expain all this, but I
        needed some text to practice some CSS stuff and Lorem Ipsum was getting
        boring.
